## BOS - Buttload of sprites

JS library that draws all your sprites with one webgl draw call per spritesheet.

### When to use

1. When you only render sprites and not much else
2. But there are a lot of them (we're talking thousands and tens of thousands)

If you need a general purpose webgl library, you're better off with Pixi.js

### What for

1. Sprite-based games that render many sprites at the same time like strategies and bullet hells.
2. Particle FX.
